The font rom in the GTAC 2 clone has the wiring from the rom to the
shift register altered from the standard way in an Apple II. Because
of this you cannot take an font rom image for an Apple II such as 
the Dan Paymar image with LowerCase and use it on the GTAC 2 without
modifications.

On the GTAC 2 the following bits of the ROM are tied to the shift
register in this order:

FONT ROM	LS166 SHIFT REGISTER
PIN 11 - O3	PIN 3 - B
PIN 17 - 08	PIN 4 - C
PIN 16 - 07	PIN 5 - D
PIN 15 - O6	PIN 10 - E
PIN 14 - O5	PIN 11 - F
PIN 13 - O4	PIN 12 - G
PIN 10 - O2	PIN 14 - H
PIN 09 - Flash/Inverse Hardware

The bits are shifted out H to A. A is tied to the flash/inverse hardware.

The program reversebits.c will take the input of an Apple standard
font rom image and modify it and output the version good for GTAC
use on stdout. The program showfont.c will read the GTAC image and
display the font chars as acii images.
